# Gif News

Gif News combines the top 20 popular news articles of the day from the NYTimes with its relevant gif from Giphy. It's meant to poke fun at the idea that people nowadays have limited attention spans and no longer read long articles, spawning the birth of 'tldr;' or 'too long don't read'.

# APIs
* [New york times](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs) for the articles
* [Giphy for gifs](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI)
* [AlchemyAPI](http://www.alchemyapi.com/) for keyword extraction
